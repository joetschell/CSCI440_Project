But if the general truths of Logic are of such a 
nature that when presented to the mind they at once command assent, wherein consists the difficulty of constructing the Science of Logic? 
Not, it may be answered, in collecting the materials of knowledge, but in discriminating their nature, and determining their mutual place and relation. 
All sciences consist of general truths, bu
t of those truths some only are primary and fundamental, others are secondary and derived. The laws of elliptic motion, discovered by Kepler, are general truths in astronomy, but they are not its fundamental truths. And it is so also in the purely 
mathematical sciences. An almost boundless diversity of theorems, which are known, and an infinite possibility of others, as yet unknown, r
est together upon the foundation of a few simple axioms; and yet these are all general truths. It may be added, that they are truths which to an intelligence sufficiently refined would shine forth in their own unborrowed light, without the need of t
hose connecting links of thought, those steps of wearisome and often painful deduction, by which the knowledge of them is actually acquired. Let us define as fundamental those laws and principles from which all other general truths of science may b
e deduced, and into which they may al
l be again resolved.
